Suave
=====

Suave makes it easier to apply smooth vertical scrolling to all of the same-page links on your website. Simply pass in all anchor tags and you are set. You can also select specific classes or IDs if you don't need it on all links.


## Usage

```javascript

// Apply to some links
$('.smooth-scroll').suave();

// Apply to all same-page links
$('a').suave();

```


## Dependencies

* jQuery: Suave was built using jQuery version 1.8.0 so anything from 1.8.0 and above should be good to go.
